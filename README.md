### Work Expectations for collaboration

- Time:
- > This repo took me 4 hours to setup from start to finish. I expect this same level of estimates otherwise it's not worth it for the business.

- My Working style
* I work very fast and have tight deadlines.
* A lot of the stuff you will have to figure out for your self.
* I expect you to use AI a lot to make the work go faster for yourself. I can give pointers and access.
* Im very short on time though there are somethings that you can do for yourself to get up to speed. Im ok with you having a look at the code, first, gather some questions you cannot figure for yourself and then we have a call to get you started.
* I will make a task as clear as i can, if something is not clear for you, you can ask.
* I work on github only. Via PRs.
